# Overview
[My Alura's profile](https://cursos.alura.com.br/vitrinedev/matheus-reirasi)

<p>
    Alura is one of the greatest technology education platform in Brazil and its mission is to change lives and careers.
</p>
<p>
    This repository contains some exercises made on platform. <br>
    My main goal here is the frontend field, containing codes using react with javascript but primarily with typescript. <br>
    Can be found here exercises about SASS, web security and network, scrum and agile, Nodejs and its tools. <br>
    Among the codes it's possible to realize the use of some code concepts like TDD, BDD, SOLID, SPA, absolute imports, DRY, SRP.
</p>
<p>
    Figma's design is designed by Alura but most of them was built from scratch by me.
